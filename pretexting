        <p>
            When it comes to social engineering, pretexting is a social engineering tactic that 
            manipulates their victim. This is done to get its user to share personal information. 
            Usally a scenario is made up to scare its victim into sharing their personal information. 
            This is done by the attacker pretending to be someone in a higher position than the victim.

        <h2> How Pretexting happens</h2>
        </body>p> 
        When a pretexting attack is happening, there is usally
         an impersonation that is happening. 
        Most attackers pretend to be someone in a 
        higher position than the victim to gain some form of credability.
        This allows for the victim to trust the attacker. Once some form of realtionship is formed 
        the attacker will ask the victim for personal information in order to steal it. 
        An attacker might also trick its victim into prefroming certain actions to exploit them.
