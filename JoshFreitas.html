<h1>Baiting</h1> 
<h2>What this is</h2> 
<p>Baiting is a real world trojan horse plays into a victims’ greed or curiosity to get them to unknowingly install the malware on to their computer. It is usually left in the form of a flash drive that is left in a public area such as an office space, parking lot, bathroom, etc. The flash drive will be labeled something enticing such as “This person’s personal files” or “This company’s payroll list” to make it look as authentic as possible. Bating doesn’t always happen in the physical world though, there are online forms such as ads that lead a user to a malicious site or encourages them to download a malware infected application.</p> 
<h2>Example</h2>
