<h1>Subtopic:3 Secure passwords.</h1>
<p>The keys to our digital kingdom, passwords should be closely protected. 
	A lot of the time, thatâ€™s all a cybercriminal needs to gain access to your account.
	Accessing sensitive data is the goal of most, if not all, cyberattacks. Hackers target databases 
    because most mission-critical and sensitive data is stored there. As such, organizations must 
    prioritize database security, and the first step is data intelligence - knowing what sensitive 
    data you have, how your database system is configured, and who has access.Therefore it is very 
    important that you have secure passwords on all your accounts</p>
