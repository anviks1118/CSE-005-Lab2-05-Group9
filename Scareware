  Scareware is defined as a cyberattack tactic that scares people into downloading malware. Scareware relates very closely to identity theft or spoofing. Scareware tricks people into downloading the malware by taking ahold of ones emotionally. They act like the computer has a virus, which they tell them that they need to download a software to “get rid” of the virus. However, there is no virus, and when they download the software, they are downloading malware, which then actually corrupts the computer. One might panic, and try to install other software’s that are suggested, but end up downloading more viruses and malware. This is the scheme of scareware.
